# TextGameJava Assignment

This repository contains my implementation of the TextGameJava assignment from the INDA course at KTH, demonstrating proficiency in Java programming, file handling, and object-oriented design. The centerpiece of the project is a text-based adventure game built on the World of Zuul framework, with custom gameplay features and clear documentation.

## Key Highlights

- **File Handling:** Worked with text files to store player data and game world models.
- **Game Design:** Created a custom game with at least 5 rooms, a clear goal, and features like traps and transporters.
- **Feature Expansion:** Enhanced the existing codebase with additional gameplay mechanics and modular design.
- **Documentation:** Used Javadoc to document all classes and methods.

## Repository Contents

- `highscore/`: File handling exercises, including reading and processing player data.
- `game/`: The text-based adventure game with a custom game world and extended features.
- `docs/`: A map of the game world and explanations of the game design and features.
